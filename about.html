    I was born in the Eastend London in the 1970's, known as the old Eastend,making me an Eastender,
    I know what your thinking ... Bianca and the Queen vic pub with a sprinkle of the BBC episodes
    of sagas.

  Growing up from childhood, technology was a different world, at most a calculator, a home cordless
    phone with gigantic video cassettes, with a VCR moving on to the early 80's.  
    My parents are Greek from Cyprus and English was something my Mother wasn't great at, a little 
    bit like my current coding! The standards or raising a child was another universe from where 
    we are today, again due to the lack of technology.
    Todays technology  provides vital sources of information, entertainment, interaction and 
    an entire social life at a press of a button.

   I am a Father to two children, well they are adults, my son is in his late 20's and 
   my daghter is 15, not forgetting my amazing doggy Storm who is a husky and my best friend.
   I have decided to investmyself in coding as I feel theres an art to creation and design 
   that brings the creative being witihin us.

    I have always had the attitude and entreprenuer mind set. The salesman comes in hand in hand
    with any career one follows, regardless if you run your own business or are employed, in this 
    instance, if you want to be employed your have to sell yourself and if you run your own show
    then you have to sell your skills or products. </p>
<p>My point being, no matter how amazing you are at your job or business, people skills are a must.
